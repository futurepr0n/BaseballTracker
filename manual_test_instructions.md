# Manual Test Instructions for PlayerPropsLadderCard Recent Games Fix

## Overview
This test verifies that the PlayerPropsLadderCard recent games fix is working correctly. The fix addresses the issue where "Recent 5 Games" showed games filtered by unique opponents instead of actual chronological recent games.

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Open Application and Developer Tools
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome or Firefox
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Clear console logs (Cmd/Ctrl+K)

### Step 2: Navigate to PlayerPropsLadderCard
1. Look for the "Player Props Ladder" card on the page
2. Verify that "Hits" is the default selected prop type (first button should be active)
3. The card should show a list of players

### Step 3: Find and Click Aaron Judge
1. Look for Aaron Judge in the hits prop player list (he should be among the top players)
2. Click on Aaron Judge's name/row
3. **WATCH THE CONSOLE** - This is where the fix debug logs should appear

### Step 4: Expected Console Debug Logs
Look for these specific debug messages in the console:

#### ‚úÖ Fix Indicator 1: Current Date Usage
```
üìÖ FIXED: Using actual current date instead of selected app date: 2025-07-22
```

#### ‚úÖ Fix Indicator 2: Game Separation
```
üìä Separated: X recent games, Y opponent history games
```

#### ‚úÖ Fix Indicator 3: Structured Data Return
```
üìä Returning structured data: X recent, Y opponent vs TEAM
```

### Step 5: Verify Recent 5 Games Chart
1. After clicking Aaron Judge, wait 3-5 seconds for the charts to load
2. Look for a "Recent 5 Games - Hits" chart section
3. The chart should show the 5 most recent games chronologically

### Expected Behavior (What the Fix Should Show)
- **Recent 5 Games should display:**
  - Jul 21, 2025: X hits vs TEAM
  - Jul 20, 2025: X hits vs TEAM  
  - Jul 19, 2025: X hits vs TEAM
  - Jul 18, 2025: X hits vs TEAM
  - Jul 17, 2025: X hits vs TEAM
  
- **NOT filtered by unique opponents** (which was the old bug)

### Troubleshooting

#### If PlayerPropsLadderCard is not visible:
- Make sure the React app is running (`npm start`)
- Check that prop analysis data exists: `/public/data/prop_analysis/prop_analysis_latest.json`
- Look for any error messages in the console

#### If Aaron Judge is not in the list:
- Check that he's in the hits prop data
- Try scrolling down or looking for "A. Judge" instead of full name
- The test found him at position #259 previously

#### If no debug logs appear:
- The component may not be loading player data properly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Verify network requests in Network tab

## What to Report
