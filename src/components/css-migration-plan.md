# CSS Migration Plan for BaseballTracker

## Overview
This plan addresses the CSS inconsistencies across mobile/desktop and light/dark modes, with special focus on fixing the SVG team logo cutoff issues.

## Issues Identified from Screenshot Analysis

### 1. Team Logo Background Issues
- Logos are being cut off due to `overflow: hidden` on player items
- Inconsistent positioning and sizing across different cards
- Some cards show logos properly (HR Rate cards) while others don't (Players Due for HR)

### 2. Row Height Inconsistencies
- "Players Due for A Home Run" - larger rows (~72px)
- "HRs by Time Slot" - compact rows (~56px)
- "Current Series Hits" - compact rows
- No standardization across cards

### 3. Visual Polish Differences
- Some cards have well-integrated team logos in rank circles
- Others have basic styling without visual enhancements
- Dark mode support is incomplete

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Create Unified Styles âœ…
- Created `PlayerItemStyles.css` with:
  - CSS custom properties for easy theming
  - Fixed logo display with proper positioning
  - Consistent row heights with compact variants
  - Complete dark mode support
  - Responsive mobile styles

### Phase 2: Update Dashboard.css
1. Remove conflicting player-item styles (lines 196-206, 719-794, 1285-1314)
2. Import the new unified styles
3. Keep only dashboard-specific layout styles
4. Add card-specific color overrides

### Phase 3: Update Individual Card Components
Each card needs to:
1. Remove local player-item CSS
2. Add appropriate class names for variants
3. Ensure proper HTML structure

## Card Update Checklist

### High Priority (Most Visible Issues)
- [ ] HRPredictionCard - Fix logo cutoff, standardize heights
- [ ] TopHittersCard - Already good, minor cleanup
- [ ] CurrentSeriesCards - Add compact class
- [ ] TimeSlotHitsCard - Add compact class
- [ ] HitStreakCard - Fix logo display

### Medium Priority
- [ ] HomeRunLeadersCard
- [ ] RecentHomersCard
- [ ] HRRateCard
- [ ] ImprovedRateCard
- [ ] PerformanceCard

### Low Priority (Working Well)
- [ ] MostHomeRunsAtHomeCard
- [ ] DayOfWeekHitsCard
- [ ] LikelyToHitCard
- [ ] ContinueStreakCard
- [ ] OpponentMatchupHitsCard

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup current styles**
   ```bash
   cp src/components/Dashboard.css src/components/Dashboard.css.backup
   ```

2. **Apply Dashboard.css patch**
   - Remove duplicate player-item styles
   - Add import for PlayerItemStyles.css

3. **Update each card component**
   - Add class="compact-card" for cards with smaller rows
   - Ensure team-logo-bg img has proper class
   - Remove card-specific player-item CSS

4. **Test across viewports**
   - Desktop (1440px+)
   - Tablet (768px)
   - Mobile (375px)
   - Dark mode toggle

5. **Verify improvements**
   - Team logos fully visible
   - Consistent row heights
   - Smooth hover effects
   - Dark mode compatibility

## Expected Results

### Before
- Cut-off team logos
- Inconsistent spacing
- Poor mobile experience
- Limited dark mode support

### After
- Full logo visibility with gradient fade
- Consistent row heights (72px standard, 56px compact)
- Optimized mobile layout
- Complete dark mode support
- Unified hover effects

## Notes
- The new system uses CSS custom properties for easy future adjustments
- Logo opacity and sizing can be tweaked via variables
- Card-specific colors are preserved via class overrides
- Mobile breakpoints are standardized at 768px and 480px
