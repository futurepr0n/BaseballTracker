# PlayerPropsLadderCard Debug Test Instructions

## What We Fixed
1. **useCallback dependency issues** - Memoized currentDate to prevent infinite re-renders
2. **Enhanced error logging** - Added detailed console logs to identify exact failure points  
3. **Function declaration order** - Fixed React hook dependency order issues
4. **Stabilized date dependencies** - Used memoized date string instead of Date object

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Application
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Go to the Console tab

### Step 2: Look for Debug Messages
The component should now show these console messages:
```
🎯 Loading pre-computed prop analysis data... {currentDate: ..., currentDateString: "2025-07-21", loadAttempt: "..."}
📅 Trying date-specific URL: /data/prop_analysis/prop_analysis_2025-07-21.json
📡 Fetch response status: 200 OK
✅ Pre-computed prop analysis loaded: {date: "2025-07-21", propsAvailable: ["hits", "rbi", "runs", "home_runs", "walks"], ...}
```

### Step 3: Verify Component Behavior
**EXPECTED (Success):**
- Component loads successfully
- Shows list of top 50 players for "Hits" prop by default
- Prop selection buttons visible (⚾ Hits, 🏃 RBI, 🏠 Runs, etc.)
- No "Retry Analysis" button visible

**UNEXPECTED (Still Broken):**
- "Retry Analysis" button appears
- Red error messages in console
- Failed network requests in Network tab

### Step 4: If Still Broken
1. Check Network tab for failed requests to `/data/prop_analysis/`
2. Look for CORS or 404 errors
3. Check for React Error Boundary messages
4. Verify the exact error message in the enhanced logging

## Technical Details
- Component now uses memoized `currentDateString` to prevent re-render loops
- Enhanced error logging shows exact failure points and request details
- Dependency arrays properly configured to prevent infinite useEffect calls
- Date handling stabilized to work with parent component's Date objects

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/cards/PlayerPropsLadderCard.js` - Fixed useCallback dependencies and added logging
