# Scratchpad Toggle Behavior Test Report

## Test Overview
Testing the fix for scratchpad toggle behavior where cards were unnecessarily refreshing data when players were added/removed from scratchpad.

## Fix Applied
- **File:** `/src/components/TeamFilterContext.js`
- **Change:** Memoized `shouldIncludePlayer` function using `useCallback` (lines 94-148)
- **Purpose:** Prevent unnecessary re-renders when scratchpad players are toggled

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Pre-Test Setup
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console logs

### Test 1: Initial Load Verification
**Expected Behavior:** Cards should load normally without excessive console logs

**Steps:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Wait for all cards to load
3. Check console for any error messages
4. Note which cards are visible on the dashboard

**Cards to Monitor:**
- hr-prediction card (Players Due for Home Runs)
- top-hitters-card (Top Hitters)
- hr-leaders-card (Home Run Leaders) 
- hit-streak-card (Current Hit Streaks)
- continue-streak-card (if visible)
- day-of-week-hits-card (Day Hit Leaders)
- likely-to-hit-card (Players Due for a Hit)
- recent-homers-card (if visible)

### Test 2: Scratchpad Toggle Test (Core Fix)
**Expected Behavior:** Toggling scratchpad should NOT cause cards to refresh data

**Steps:**
1. Clear console logs
2. Look for star icons (★/☆) next to player names in various cards
3. Click on a star icon to add a player to scratchpad
4. **Monitor Console:** Should see minimal logs, NO data loading messages
5. Click the same star to remove player from scratchpad
6. **Monitor Console:** Should see minimal logs, NO data loading messages
7. Repeat with 3-5 different players across different cards

**Critical Check Points:**
- Cards should NOT show loading spinners when toggling
- Console should NOT show messages like:
  - "Loading HR predictions..."
  - "Loading rolling stats..."
  - "Loading hit streak data..."
  - "Refreshing card data..."
- Player data should remain visible and stable
- Star icons should toggle correctly (★ ↔ ☆)

### Test 3: Scratchpad Filter Test
**Expected Behavior:** Scratchpad filtering should still work correctly

**Steps:**
1. Add 3-5 players to scratchpad using star icons
2. Look for scratchpad filter controls (usually near team filters)
3. Enable scratchpad filtering
4. **Verify:** Only scratchpad players should be visible in cards
5. Disable scratchpad filtering  
6. **Verify:** All players should be visible again

### Test 4: Combined Filtering Test
**Expected Behavior:** Team + Scratchpad filtering should work together

**Steps:**
1. Add players from different teams to scratchpad
2. Select a team filter (dropdown or team selection)
3. Enable scratchpad filter
4. **Verify:** Only scratchpad players from selected team are shown
5. Toggle scratchpad players while both filters are active
6. **Monitor:** Cards should NOT refresh when toggling scratchpad

### Test 5: Performance Monitoring
**Expected Behavior:** Smooth interaction without performance issues

**Steps:**
1. In DevTools, go to Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Rapidly toggle 10+ scratchpad players
4. Stop recording
5. **Analyze:** Should see minimal React re-renders, no excessive function calls

## Specific Console Patterns to Watch For

### ✅ GOOD (Expected After Fix):
```
[PlayerScratchpadContext] Player added to scratchpad: PlayerName
[PlayerScratchpadContext] Player removed from scratchpad: PlayerName
[DEBUG] Scratchpad updated: 3 players
```

### ❌ BAD (Indicates Fix Failed):
```
[CARDS] Loading HR predictions data...
[Dashboard] Refreshing rolling stats...
[TopHittersCard] Data reload triggered
[StatLoader] Loading data for date...
useEffect triggered in [CardName]
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix (Problem):
- Toggling scratchpad → Cards reload data
- Console floods with loading messages
- Loading spinners appear
- Poor performance with multiple toggles

### After Fix (Solution):
- Toggling scratchpad → No data reloads
- Console stays clean (only scratchpad messages)
- No loading spinners
- Smooth performance

## Test Results (Fill in manually)

### Test 1 - Initial Load:

## Developer Notes
The fix specifically addresses the `shouldIncludePlayer` function dependency array in TeamFilterContext.js. The memoization with `useCallback` ensures that:

1. The function reference stays stable when scratchpad players change
2. Cards that depend on this function don't unnecessarily re-render
3. Only actual filtering logic changes trigger updates
4. Scratchpad functionality remains fully intact

Key dependencies in the memoization:
- `scratchpadContext?.filterEnabled`
- `selectedTeam`, `includeMatchup`, `matchupTeam`
- `teamData`, `teamRosterMap`
- `scratchpadContext?.shouldIncludePlayer`

The fix excludes the full `scratchpadContext` object from dependencies, which was causing unnecessary re-renders when the scratchpad state changed.
