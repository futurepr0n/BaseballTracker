# PlayerPropsLadderCard Unlimited Data Loading Test Report

## Test Date: July 21, 2025

## Implementation Review

### Key Changes Implemented:
1. **New Function: `loadPlayerDataUnlimited`**
   - Bypasses SharedDataManager's 30-date limit
   - Implements two-phase loading strategy:
     - Phase 1: Loads most recent 60 days (prioritizes July 2025 data)
     - Phase 2: Loads additional 90 days for historical context (150 days total)
   - Direct file loading instead of using SharedDataManager
   - Skips weekends and off-season dates for efficiency

### Console Logging Added:
- `🔍 UNLIMITED: Loading comprehensive data for [player] ([team])`
- `📅 UNLIMITED: Loaded [X] players for [date]`
- `📊 UNLIMITED: Phase 1 complete - loaded [X] recent dates`
- `📅 UNLIMITED: Loading additional historical data...`
- `📊 UNLIMITED: Complete - loaded [X] total dates with data`

## Test Setup Verification

### Data Availability:
✅ **Prop Analysis Data**: Available for 2025-07-21
✅ **July 2025 Game Data**: 27 files available (July 1-31, with some gaps)

  - Season Total: 132 hits
  - Rate: 1.307
  - Recent Rate: 1.31
  - Games: 101

### Implementation Details:
✅ **Function Integration**: `loadPlayerDataUnlimited` is called when a player is selected
✅ **Date Handling**: Properly handles 2025 season start date (March 18, 2025)
✅ **Error Handling**: Silent handling of missing dates with continue statements

## Expected Behavior When Testing:

### 1. **Initial Load**:
- Navigate to PlayerPropsLadderCard in Dashboard or Pinheads Playhouse
- Should see list of players sorted by probability

### 2. **Select Aaron Judge**:
- Look for "A. Judge" (NYY) in the player list
- Click to select

### 3. **Console Output Expected**:
```
🔍 UNLIMITED: Loading comprehensive data for A. Judge (NYY)
📅 UNLIMITED: Loaded [X] players for 2025-07-21
📅 UNLIMITED: Loaded [X] players for 2025-07-20
📅 UNLIMITED: Loaded [X] players for 2025-07-19
... (more July dates)
📊 UNLIMITED: Phase 1 complete - loaded [X] recent dates
```

### 4. **Chart Display**:
- Should now show July 2025 dates instead of April/May
