3. **Priority 3**: Fix Chicago White Sox data collection configuration for 25 dates
4. **Priority 4**: Implement validation alerts for missing player data in final games

## Verification Steps
After fixes, verify player counts:
- Aaron Judge: Should have 26 HRs in 74 games (currently 25 HRs in 72 games)
- Shohei Ohtani: Should have 26 HRs in 74 games (currently 24 HRs in 73 games)

## Impact Analysis
