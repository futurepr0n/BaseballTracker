# Pinheads Playhouse Analysis Methodology

## Overview

Pinheads Playhouse uses a sophisticated multi-source data integration system to provide comprehensive baseball analysis for daily fantasy and betting decisions. This document explains the methodologies, data sources, and calculation processes that power the analysis engine.

## Data Integration Architecture

### Three-Tier Data System

The analysis engine integrates data from three primary sources to create the most complete statistical picture:

#### 1. **CSV Statistical Files** (Season-Long Data)
- **Source**: BaseballScraper processed statistics
- **Format**: "lastname, firstname" player identification
- **Content**: Comprehensive season statistics including:
  - `custom_pitcher_2025.csv` - Advanced pitcher metrics
  - `pitcher_exit_velocity_2025.csv` - Statcast velocity data  
  - `pitcherpitcharsenalstats_2025.csv` - Pitch-by-pitch arsenal analysis
  - `hitter_exit_velocity_2025.csv` - Batter contact quality
  - `hitterpitcharsenalstats_2025.csv` - Batter vs pitch type performance

#### 2. **JSON Daily Game Files** (Game-by-Game Performance)
- **Source**: `data/2025/<month>/<month>_<day>_<year>.json`
- **Format**: "firstname lastname" player identification
- **Content**: Individual game performance data including:
  - Pitcher: IP, H, R, ER, BB, K, HR per game
  - Batter: AB, H, R, RBI, HR, BB, K per game
  - Team affiliations and game context

#### 3. **Roster Mapping** (Player Identification)
- **Source**: `rosters.json`
- **Format**: Multiple name formats for cross-referencing
- **Content**: Player team assignments, handedness, positions

### Data Integration Process

```javascript
// 1. Search CSV files for season statistics
const csvData = await searchPitcherInCSV(pitcherName);

// 2. Search JSON files for game-by-game data  
const jsonData = await searchPitcherInJSON(pitcherName);

// 3. Integrate sources with CSV priority for season stats
const integratedStats = integratePitcherData(csvData, jsonData);
```

## Calculation Methodologies

### Pitcher Analysis

#### Full-Season Statistics Aggregation
- **Search Scope**: Entire 2025 season (January 1 - Present)
- **Data Points**: All pitcher appearances across daily JSON files
- **Calculations**:
  ```javascript
  ERA = (totalEarnedRuns * 9.0) / totalInnings
  WHIP = (totalWalks + totalHits) / totalInnings  
  K/Game = totalStrikeouts / totalGames
  HR/Game = totalHomeRuns / totalGames
  ```

#### Recent Form Analysis (Last 10 Games)
- **Purpose**: Trend detection and current form assessment
- **Metrics**:
  ```javascript
  recent_era = (recentEarnedRuns * 9.0) / recentInnings
  recent_k_per_game = recentStrikeouts / recentGames.length
  recent_hr_per_game = recentHomeRuns / recentGames.length
  ```

### Batter Analysis

#### League Average Predictions (Fallback System)
When BaseballAPI data is unavailable, the system generates comprehensive fallback predictions:

- **75-Field Structure**: Matches API response format exactly
- **League Baseline**: HR probability 4.5-7.5%, Hit probability 24.5-30.5%
- **Adjustments**:
  - Batting order position (+2% per position up in order)
  - Handedness vs pitcher (+5% LHB vs RHP)
  - Stadium factors (park-specific HR multipliers)

#### Data Quality Assessment
```javascript
const lowDataFlags = checkForLowDataConditions(batter, pitcherStats);
// Flags include:
// - Pitcher <10 games played
// - Generated vs real pitcher stats  
// - Fallback vs active lineup players
// - Confidence penalties (0-40% reduction)
```

### Lineup Prioritization System

#### Smart Lineup Detection (Priority Order)
1. **Today's Starting Lineup** (Highest Priority)
   - Sources: `starting_lineups_{date}.json`, `today_lineups.json`
   - Flag: `fromStartingLineup: true`

2. **Recent Game Data** (Active Players)
   - Sources: Last 7 days of daily JSON files
   - Flag: `fromRecentGames: true`

3. **Roster Data** (Season Roster)
   - Source: `rosters.json` 
   - Flag: `fromRoster: true` + warning indicators

4. **Fallback Generation** (Last Resort)
   - Generated realistic player names
   - Flag: `isFallback: true`

### PropFinder Integration

#### Pitcher Strikeout Props Analysis
```javascript
// Extract pitcher data from batter predictions
const pitcherData = extractPitcherDataFromPredictions(predictions);

// Calculate strikeout probability based on:
kPerGame = pitcher_k_per_game || (pitcher_home_k_total / pitcher_home_games) || 6.5
// Opposition strikeout vulnerability
// Expected innings pitched
// Handedness matchups
```

#### Prop Thresholds
- **4+ Strikeouts**: Baseline expectation for starters
- **5+ Strikeouts**: Above-average performance expectation  
- **6+ Strikeouts**: Strong outing expectation
- **7+ Strikeouts**: Dominant performance expectation
- **8+ Strikeouts**: Elite performance expectation

## Enhanced Features

### Name Matching System
Handles multiple naming conventions across data sources:
```javascript
// Input: "John Smith"
// Generates: ["Smith, John", "J. Smith", "John Smith", "Smith"]
const variations = generatePitcherNameVariations(pitcherName);
```

### Confidence Scoring
- **High Confidence** (80%+): Full CSV + JSON integration, 15+ games
- **Medium Confidence** (50-79%): Partial data, 10-14 games
- **Low Confidence** (30-49%): Limited data, 5-9 games  
- **Very Low Confidence** (<30%): Fallback/generated data

### Team Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// 1. Search recent games for pitcher appearances
// 2. Check today's schedule for opposing teams
// 3. Cross-reference with lineup data
// 4. Fallback to 'OPP' placeholder if uncertain
```

## Sorting and Results Logic

### Comprehensive Analysis Before Limiting
1. **Generate predictions for ALL available players** (not just first N)
2. **Sort by hr_score/score descending** (best predictions first)
3. **Apply limit to get top N results** (ensures actual best predictions)
4. **Enhanced logging**: Shows total analyzed vs returned, score ranges

### Data Quality Indicators
```javascript
prediction.low_data_warning = true/false
prediction.low_data_reasons = ["Pitcher <10 games", "Generated stats", ...]
prediction.data_quality = "very_low" | "low" | "medium" | "high"
prediction.data_source = "csv_json_integrated" | "csv_only" | "json_only" | "league_average"
```

## API Integration Points

### BaseballAPI Primary Analysis
- **Enhanced Endpoint**: `/analyze/pitcher-vs-team` (with missing data handling)
- **Fallback Endpoint**: `/pitcher-vs-team` (requires complete data)
- **Response Enhancement**: Automatic dashboard context integration

### Client-Side Fallback System
When API fails completely:
1. **Load team batting lineup** (prioritizing active players)
2. **Generate comprehensive pitcher stats** (CSV + JSON integration)
3. **Create 75-field predictions** (matching API format)
4. **Apply confidence scoring** (based on data quality)

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Lineup Data**: 15-minute cache for today's lineups
- **Player Data**: 5-minute cache for recent lookups
- **CSV Data**: Session-based caching for statistical files

### Parallel Processing
```javascript
// Generate predictions for all batters simultaneously
const predictionPromises = teamBatters.map(async (batter, index) => {
  return generateLeagueAveragePrediction(batter, pitcherName, teamAbbr, index);
});
const predictions = await Promise.all(predictionPromises);
```

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Graceful Degradation
1. **API Failure** → Client-side fallback system
2. **Missing CSV Data** → JSON-only analysis  
3. **Missing JSON Data** → CSV-only analysis
4. **No Real Data** → League average generation
5. **Unknown Pitcher Team** → 'OPP' placeholder

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: Automatic validation and fallback value assignment
- **Range Checking**: ERA (1.00-15.00), WHIP (0.50-3.00), K/Game (0-20)
- **Sample Size Warnings**: Automatic flags for insufficient data

## Future Enhancement Areas

### Planned Improvements
1. **Weather Integration**: Wind and temperature effects on HR probability
2. **Ballpark Factors**: Park-specific adjustments for all statistics  
3. **Situational Analysis**: Day/night, home/away, rest days
4. **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition for hot/cold streaks
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live game situation adjustments

### Data Quality Enhancements
1. **Umpire Analysis**: Strike zone consistency effects
2. **Injury Tracking**: Player health status integration
3. **Workload Management**: Pitcher fatigue indicators
4. **Opponent Quality**: Strength of schedule adjustments
