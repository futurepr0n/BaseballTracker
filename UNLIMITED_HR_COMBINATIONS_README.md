# Unlimited HR Combinations Generator

## Overview

The enhanced HR combinations script (`generate_hr_combinations_unlimited.py`) removes all artificial limits from the original implementation and creates separate output files for each combination size with optimized streaming processing.

## Key Improvements

### 🚀 No Artificial Limits
- **Removed 10,000 combination cap** from original implementation
- **Removed output size restrictions** - processes all meaningful combinations
- **Unlimited memory processing** with streaming optimization

### 💾 Memory Optimization
- **Streaming processing** - doesn't load everything into memory at once
- **Garbage collection** - periodic cleanup during processing
- **Batch processing** - handles large datasets efficiently
- **Memory-safe data structures** - optimized for large-scale processing

### 📁 Separate Output Files
- **hr_combinations_by_2.json** - 2-player combinations (3+ occurrences)
- **hr_combinations_by_3.json** - 3-player combinations (3+ occurrences)  
- **hr_combinations_by_4.json** - 4-player combinations (2+ occurrences)

### 🎯 Frequency-Based Filtering
- **2-player combinations**: Minimum 3+ occurrences
- **3-player combinations**: Minimum 3+ occurrences
- **4-player combinations**: Minimum 2+ occurrences (easier to achieve)

## Performance Results

- **Date Range**: 2025-03-19 to 2025-07-27
- **Season Coverage**: Excellent (120 days with HR data)

### Generated Combinations
- **2-player**: 8,115 combinations (6.82 MB file)
- **3-player**: 8 combinations (0.01 MB file)
- **4-player**: 13 combinations (0.02 MB file)
- **Total**: 8,136 meaningful combinations

## Data Quality Features

### 📊 Comprehensive Statistics
Each output file includes:
- Total occurrences across all combinations
- Average occurrences per combination
- Maximum occurrences found
- Total HRs across all combinations
- Average HRs per combination

### 🏆 Season HR Totals
- Full season HR totals calculated for all 1,112 unique players
- Season leaders properly identified (C. Raleigh: 41 HRs, S. Ohtani: 39 HRs)
- Player stats integrated into combination data

### ⚡ Performance Metrics
Each combination includes:
- Number of occurrences
- Total HRs across all occurrences
- Date range (first to last occurrence)
- Days since last occurrence
- Frequency per 30-day period
- Average HRs per occurrence

## Technical Architecture

### Streaming Processing
```python
# Memory-optimized processing with periodic garbage collection
for date_str, hr_players in daily_hr_data.items():
    if processed_days % 10 == 0:
        gc.collect()  # Prevent memory buildup
    
    # Process combinations in batches
    combo_count = 0
    for combo in combinations(unique_list, group_size):
        # Memory limits per day to prevent overload
        if group_size == 2 and combo_count > 5000:
            break
```

### Frequency Filtering
```python
# Quality-based filtering instead of arbitrary limits
min_occurrences = {2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2}
quality_combinations = {
    k: v for k, v in real_combinations.items() 
    if len(v) >= min_occurrences[group_size]
}
```

### Separate File Generation
```python
# Individual files with comprehensive metadata
for group_size in [2, 3, 4]:
    file_data = {
        'groupSize': group_size,
        'minimumOccurrences': min_occurrences[group_size],
        'totalCombinations': len(combinations),
        'statistics': {...},
        'combinations': combinations
    }
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Script
```bash
cd BaseballTracker
python3 generate_hr_combinations_unlimited.py
```

### Output Files Location
- **Directory**: `public/data/hr_combinations/`
- **Current Files**: `hr_combinations_by_2.json`, `hr_combinations_by_3.json`, `hr_combinations_by_4.json`
- **Timestamped Files**: Backup versions with timestamp in filename

### Integration with BaseballTracker
The generated JSON files can be consumed by the React frontend for:
- Combination analysis and visualization
- Player performance tracking
- Predictive analytics based on historical combinations
- Strategic betting insights
