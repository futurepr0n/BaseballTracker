## Key Baseball Analytics Concepts

### Expected Statistics (xStats)
Based on Statcast data using exit velocity and launch angle to predict outcomes. Higher values indicate better underlying performance that may not be reflected in traditional stats due to luck or defense.

### Barrels
Optimal combination of exit velocity and launch angle that historically produces the best offensive outcomes. Generally requires 98+ mph exit velocity with launch angles between 26-30 degrees.

### Launch Angle
The vertical angle at which the ball leaves the bat. Sweet spot is typically 8-32 degrees. Lower angles produce ground balls, higher angles produce pop ups.

### Plate Discipline  
Metrics measuring a hitter's ability to identify balls and strikes. Good plate discipline involves swinging at strikes and taking balls.

### Pitch Movement
- **Break**: Total deviation from straight path due to spin and gravity
- **Induced Break**: Movement caused by spin, separate from gravity  
- **Horizontal Break**: Side-to-side movement
- **Vertical Break**: Up-and-down movement

### Quality of Contact
Classification system for batted balls based on exit velocity and launch angle combinations, ranging from poor contact to barrels.
