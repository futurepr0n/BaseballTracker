// Returns comprehensive analysis with opportunities, pitcher intelligence, alerts
```

**Creating Player Badges:**
```javascript
import { badgeManager } from './utils/playerBadgeSystem';

const badge = badgeManager.createBadge('HOT_STREAK', { source: 'dashboard_context' });
const category = badgeManager.categorizePlayer(badges, baseScore);
```

```

### Data Dependencies
This application requires:
1. **BaseballScraper** CSV files in `../BaseballScraper/` directory
2. **BaseballAPI** running on localhost:8000 for advanced analysis features
3. MLB schedule data (generated by scheduleGenerator.js)
4. Daily statistics JSON files in the date-based directory structure
