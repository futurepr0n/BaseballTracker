# Testing Travel Impact Fix - UPDATED

## Major Fixes Applied:

### ✅ **Travel Data Structure Fix**
- Fixed the data structure mismatch between enhancedTravelService and UI expectations
- UI now receives proper `performanceImpact` object that it needs to display travel data

### ✅ **Table Layout Fix**  
- Removed forced `min-width: 785px` constraint causing horizontal scrolling
- Table now fits naturally within the available space

## Steps to Verify the Fix:

1. **Navigate to HR-Matchups**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/hr-matchups
   - The page should load without horizontal scrolling

2. **Find ATL @ STL Game**:
   - Look for the game card showing "ATL @ STL"
   - Click on it to select it

3. **Check Player Analysis Tab**:
   - Click on the "Player Analysis" tab
   - Look at the ATL players in the table

4. **Verify Travel Impact**:
   - In the table, ATL players should show negative travel impact in the "Travel" column
   - Look for values like -8 to -12 (red negative numbers)

5. **Expand Player Details** (Key Test):
   - Click the arrow (▶) next to any ATL player
   - In the expanded section, look for "Travel Impact"
   - **SHOULD NOW SHOW** instead of "No travel data available":
     - Travel Distance: ~1731 miles
     - Classification: cross country
     - Days of Rest: 0
     - Consecutive Games: 1
     - Description: "Traveled 1731 miles from Oakland Coliseum. cross country trip with -12 impact."

## Expected Results:

### ✅ Before Fix:
- Travel Impact: 0 in table
- "No travel data available" in expanded details
- Horizontal scrolling required

### ✅ After Fix:
- Travel Impact: -12 in table (red negative number)
- Full travel details in expanded section
- Table fits naturally without scrolling

## Key Technical Changes:

1. **Enhanced Travel Service**: Now returns UI-compatible data structure with `performanceImpact` object
2. **CSS Layout**: Removed fixed width constraints causing scrolling issues
3. **Data Flow**: Proper venue mapping and previous game detection

The travel impact calculation correctly identifies that ATL traveled 1731 miles from Oakland to St. Louis and applies a -12 cross-country travel fatigue penalty.
