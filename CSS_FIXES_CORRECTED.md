# CSS Fixes - Corrected Implementation

## Issues Addressed Based on Feedback

### 1. ✅ **Made SVG Logos More Pronounced**
**Problem**: Logos became too faded after initial fix
**Solution**: 
- Increased opacity: `0.06` → `0.12` (double the visibility)
- Increased hover opacity: `0.09` → `0.18`
- Improved mask gradient for better visibility
- Larger logo size: `140%` → `160%` height

### 2. ✅ **Fixed Dark Navy Card Backgrounds**
**Problem**: Cards like "Top HR Rate This Season" still had dark navy backgrounds
**Solution**: 
- Replaced solid dark backgrounds with light alpha-blended gradients
- All cards now have consistent light theme matching the dashboard
- Examples:
  - **Top Hitters**: `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.08) 0%, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.03) 100%)`
  - **HR Rate**: `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.08) 0%, rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.03) 100%)`
  - **Hit Streaks**: `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.08) 0%, rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.03) 100%)`

### 3. ✅ **Unified Light Alpha-Blended Theme**
**Problem**: Inconsistent card appearances across dashboard
**Solution**:
- All cards now use light alpha-blended backgrounds
- Matches existing cards like "Current Hit Streaks" (light blue), "Players Due for a Hit" (light green)
- Consistent 8% to 3% gradient fade pattern
- Professional, cohesive appearance

## Team Logo Enhancements

--logo-opacity-hover: 0.18; /* Stronger on hover */

.team-logo-bg {
  height: 160%; /* Larger for better visibility */
  max-width: 200px;
  /* Better mask for pronounced but clean appearance */
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(0,0,0,1) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.6) 70%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 100%);
}
```

## Before vs After (Final)

### Before Issues ❌
- SVG logos too faded/subtle
- Dark navy card backgrounds inconsistent with theme
- "Top HR Rate This Season" and similar cards looked out of place
- Inconsistent visual hierarchy

### After Improvements ✅  
- **Team logos highly visible** - doubled opacity for clear background presence
- **Light alpha-blended backgrounds** - all cards match the dashboard theme
- **Consistent gradients** - 8% to 3% fade pattern across all cards
- **Professional appearance** - matches existing well-designed cards
- **Unified color system** - each card type has distinct but harmonious theming

## Technical Implementation

### Logo Enhancement

  height: 160%; /* Larger size */
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(0,0,0,1) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.6) 70%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 100%);
}
```

### Card Background System
```css
/* LIGHT THEME - Consistent with dashboard */
.card-name {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(COLOR, 0.08) 0%, rgba(COLOR, 0.03) 100%);
}
```
